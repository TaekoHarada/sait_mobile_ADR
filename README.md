Reactive native will be chosen for the application for its popularity when it comes to building a hybrid app with many external resources and a large community for developers to learn.
 Ensuring smooth users interaction with the application such as offline browsing and viewing order history, push notification, using the loyalty program features to earn and redeem points for future discount. 
 
Backend language: Node.js 

Node.js will be use as the backend language for the application since it provides great support for real-time data update and syncing great amounts of data smoothly when connects to the internet 
Good scalability that can handle increased load without requiring significant changes to the backend infrastructure 
High performance in I/O bound tasks to help process payment, tracking user behavior, push notification 

Permissions: Fine-grained access control
